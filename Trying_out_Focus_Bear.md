# User Feedback â€“ Desktop App Experience

## Overall Experience

I appreciate that the application includes structured routines and incorporates the Pomodoro technique for effective task time management. These features have been particularly helpful in improving my productivity.

## Suggestions for Improvement

### 1. User Interface & Installation Process
- The installation process could be more intuitive for first-time users.  
- Simplifying the setup steps would enhance the user experience.

### 2. Language Support
- When switching the app language to Spanish, some parts of the interface remain untranslated.  
- This might create difficulties for users who do not speak English.

### 3. App Design & Functionality
- It would be useful to improve basic window controls, such as allowing the app to be minimized to the taskbar.

### 4. Tutorials in Multiple Languages
- Providing tutorials in both English and Spanish would make the app more accessible to a wider audience.
