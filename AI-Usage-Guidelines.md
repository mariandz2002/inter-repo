#### When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?
I think we can use AI as support when we donâ€™t have a structured idea. It helps us build and modify our thoughts to make them stronger.
#### How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?
#### To avoid becoming overly reliant on AI, it is necessary to find the right balance between leveraging its capabilities and maintaining human oversight.
#### What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?
#### Avoid Sharing Sensitive Information,I will never input personal, financial, or confidential company data into AI tools. Also I consider it is impotant to read and understand how AI tools handle, store, and process data before using them.
