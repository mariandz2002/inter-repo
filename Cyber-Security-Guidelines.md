### 1. What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?
#### Currently, I follow several security measures such as using two-factor authentication (2FA) on all my important accounts, creating unique and complex passwords using a password manager, and avoiding suspicious links or downloads. However, I can improve by updating my passwords more regularly and being more cautious when using public Wi-Fi networks without a VPN.

### 2. How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?
#### To make secure behaviour a habit, I can incorporate it into my daily digital routine—just like locking my front door when I leave home. Setting regular reminders for security checks, enabling automatic updates, and educating myself about common cyber threats can help turn secure behaviour into second nature.

### 3. What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?
#### I will continue using a password manager to generate and store strong passwords, avoid reusing passwords across platforms, enable 2FA wherever possible, and periodically audit my accounts for any unusual activity. Additionally, I’ll avoid storing sensitive login information in unsecured files or emails.

### 4. What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?
#### If I suspected a breach, I would immediately change the password for the affected account and any others that use the same credentials. I’d also check my account activity, revoke any unauthorized sessions, and report the incident to the relevant platform or IT support. If sensitive information was compromised, I’d consider placing a fraud alert or freezing my credit if necessary.
