## What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)
- I will start using a laptop stand to raise my screen to eye level and reduce neck strain.
- I’ll invest in an external keyboard and mouse to improve my wrist posture.
- Adjusting my chair height and desk setup will help me maintain a more ergonomic position.
## What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? (e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)
- I’ll make a conscious effort to sit upright with my back fully supported.
- I’ll take short movement breaks every 30–60 minutes to stretch and reset my posture.
- I’ll ensure my screen is at the right height and distance to prevent eye and neck strain.
## How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day?
- I’ll use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks.
- Placing a sticky note on my desk with a posture reminder will help me stay mindful.
- I’ll make it a habit to stand up or stretch every time I complete a task or finish a meeting
- I'll use the deep work or pomodoro sesion of Focus Bear.
