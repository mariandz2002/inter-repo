## Cyber Security


### **Common cyber security threats in a remote work environment.**

##### *1.Phishing Attacks:* By far, the most common form of cyber threat against remote employees is phishing. Attackers simply blast out fraudulent emails designed to trick employees into divulging their login credentials or opening and downloading malicious files.
##### *2. Poor Password Practices:* Most remote workers use weak passwords or keep using the same password for all different accounts, which raises the possibility of unauthorized access. An attack would then leverage weak authentication to break into systems. Unless a company has applied strict policies regarding strong passwords and multi-factor authentication, it may be in grave danger. 
##### *3. Insecure Wi-Fi Networks:* Many remote workers connect via public or unsecured Wi-Fi in cafes or other shared spaces, making them the perfect vector for cybercriminals. These networks are not encrypted; it‚Äôs pretty easy for attackers to intercept data.
##### *4. Cloud Storage Vulnerabilities:* Cloud storage is the source through which remote workers share and collaborate on files. However, when cloud storage platforms are not set up properly, they become a source of data breaches.
##### *5. Shadow IT* : Shadow IT refers to the use of unauthorized applications or services by employees to solve work-related problems without any approval or recognition by IT. Unsolicited tools bypass security protocols, and that all adds up to unregulated data sharing. Shadow IT increases the potential for data breaches and presents an array of vulnerabilities to the network. 

###  **Best practices for keeping your devices and accounts secure**
##### *1.Implement MFA (Multi-factor Authentication):* MFA adds an extra layer of security where users must verify their identity via at least two different factors, something like a password and a one-time code.
##### *2. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):* VPNs serve to secure remote connections by encrypting data traffic between the remote worker and the company network. This encryption prevents cyber criminals from intercepting sensitive information, even on unsecured public Wi-Fi networks. 
##### *3. Data Encryption Policy:* Robust data encryption policies ensure that sensitive information is not compromised during transmission and storage. Full-disk encryption of devices for remote employees secures unauthorized access to data in case the device gets lost or stolen. In addition, this prevents data from being intercepted in the course of online exchanges.
##### *4. Security Awareness Training:* The culture of security awareness should be built with training for the employees working remotely to equip them with the knowledge of how to identify and avoid cyber threats. Training programs should cover phishing scams, social engineering attacks, and password practices

### **Why is it important to lock your computer when away from your desk?**
##### It is important to prevent unauthorized people from accessing your files, emails or sensitive data or information, also to protect your work and personal information. 

### **How should you handle phishing attempts and suspicious links?**
##### Deleting and not opening suspicious links. In some cases, simply opening a phishing email may compromise the security of our Personally Identifiable Information. We should delete it immediately to prevent ourselves from accidentally opening the message in the future. Also, we must make sure not to download any attachments that accompany the message.

### **What makes a strong password, and why should you use a password manager?**
##### A combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Not a word that can be found in a dictionary or the name of a person, character, product, or organization. Significantly different from your previous passwords. Easy for you to remember but difficult for others to guess.
### **Why is two-factor authentication (2FA) important, and when should you enable it?** 
#####  it adds an extra layer of security to your accounts and protects your personal information. You should enable 2FA for all of your accounts, including email, social media, and banking. 

###### üìù Reflection

##### What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?
##### I used to use a Data Encryption Policy and MFA for my accounts. Something I didn‚Äôt know about was the use of a VPN, and I think it‚Äôs something I should improve on.

##### How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?
##### Be consistent and persistent, and try to break all these bad habits because it is your work, and you need to be professional

##### What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?
##### 1. Use Strong and Unique Passwords
##### 2. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
##### 3. Use a Password Manager 
##### 4. Be Cautious with Phishing Attempts

##### What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?
##### If I suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on my account, I would immediately change my password, enable or review multi-factor authentication (MFA), log out of all devices, check account activity and security logs, secure any linked accounts, scan my devices for malware, report the incident to the relevant authority (such as IT support or my bank), and monitor for further suspicious activity.
